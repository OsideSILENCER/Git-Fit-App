## Description

    Full-stack web application web application using the MVC paradigm, with server-side API, user authentication, and database connection.

    With the app the user can sign-up, login, and generate a workout with exercises/set/reps, by simply choosing a day of the week and a body part focused workout.

## Installation

    This application is designed with a login feature where a returning user can login or a new user can create an account with their email & password. The login feature uses the express-session NPM package and stores that information in MySQL via Sequelize.
